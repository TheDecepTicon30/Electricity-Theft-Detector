# Electricity-Theft-Detector
A system to detect electricity theft over a single-phase line was designed. The system showed the current variations that occur due to the theft on an online platform in the form of graph. It uses a IOT concept of using an Arduino programmed to work with sensors to read the Voltage and Amperes in the circuit and sends the data to cloud which handles the database of this system. Then a dedicated web application shows the dashboard usage of the electricity and informs any real theft detection by confirming any anomalies in the data by using Machine Learning algorithm which then system notifies the user accordingly. We used ThinkSpeak as the cloud where the data was stored and would act as a Cloud DB.
